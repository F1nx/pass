p@ssâ„¢ - JavaScript Edition: Forget Your Passwords.

Based on the key fob developed by Russtopia Labs, this tool is able to help you generate custom & secure passwords while making it easy to memorize and keep your codes.

Usage
-
To use, simply pull up the `.html` file and adjust the fob until you have a pattern that you are able to remember. If that doesn't do enough, you can also adjust the rotors and scramble them around to your liking! Just remember to have your adjustments recorded somewhere in case you clear your local storage.
